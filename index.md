## Covid 19 Resources
- [Clark County, Nevada](https://www.southernnevadahealthdistrict.org/coronavirus#cases). Data collected by the Southern Nevada Health District
- [State of Nevada Department of HHS](https://app.powerbigov.us/view?r=eyJrIjoiMjA2ZThiOWUtM2FlNS00MGY5LWFmYjUtNmQwNTQ3Nzg5N2I2IiwidCI6ImU0YTM0MGU2LWI4OWUtNGU2OC04ZWFhLTE1NDRkMjcwMzk4MCJ9). Statewide Data collection for Nevada
- [Covid 19 Projections](https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america).  National projections for USA
- [Daily Testing Trends in the United States](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/individual-states?fbclid=IwAR02lG-1TMD6qsQ8zJ1-sMgdR-NbrN5K2R80Few3Wpe1M3Hz7TsndHTLBeoWhenever), Testing Positivity Rate by JHU state by state.   So much local variation of test positivity rate within our country! Lower than 5-7% indicates good community control.  This number is a reflection of access to testing, contact tracing, and containment of community spread with recommended quarantine and isolation. Also indirectly answers the question, does your community adhere to recommended public health measures: masks, social distancing, hand washing?
- [Governor Sisolak Press Releases](https://nvhealthresponse.nv.gov/news-resources/press-releases/).  The Aug 14 [Road to Recovery](https://nvhealthresponse.nv.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Road-to-Recovery.pdf) key talking points:  
>*Statewide critical metrics are tracked and monitored: hospital capacity, access to PPE, testing capacity, contact tracing success, protection of vulnerable populations, enforcement, and can supercede Covid Data.*<br>  
>*If county meets two of the three criteria in 2 consecutive weeks it is flagged. (0 low risk, 1 growing risk, 2 moderate risk, 3 high level risk)*<br> 

 1. At the county level elevated disease transmission is assessed by the following: 
      * Not enough tests (if avg # tests per day <150 per 100,000)
      * Case rate (if >200 per 100,000)
      * Case rate >50 per 100,000 AND test positivity > 7.0%
      
 2. Mitigation levels determined each week by the Tast Force  for each couty to determine continuing, relaxing, or escalating level: 
      * Baseline: current directive
      * Mitigation Level 1: target approach to reduce capcity and gathering in that county.  For example certain high risk settings like restaurants, the pool, gym, bar, the capacity may have capacity reducted from 50% to 25%, or a creed to reduce public gatherings to 25 people, etc, 
      * Mitigation 2: potential return to Phase 1 or to close indoor dining, etc.  `(updated 8-29-2020)`
## Covid 19 CME materials
- [Infectious Disease Society of America Podcasts](https://www.idsociety.org/Podcasts/), also avaialbe on podcast and spotify
- [Coursera, Contact Tracing Course from Johns Hopkins Univeristy](https://www.coursera.org/learn/covid-19-contact-tracing).  A free online course to better understand the timeline for contact tracing. Key Points:
   * A person can be infected by Covid 18 and not know it.  The incubation period (time to developesymptoms) can be 2-14 days.  The average incubation period is 5 days.  Person is most infectious to others on Day 1 of symptoms, but can be infectious to others from T minus 2 days to T + 10 days. (T = Day 1).  
   * _Isolation_ keep sick person separate for the duration of the infectious period.  T-2 to T+10 days and if symptoms imroving and afebrile more than 24 hours can come out of isolation, whichever is longer `(as of 8-28-2020)`.  
   * _Quarantine_ restrict the movement of healthy people for 14 days since last contact with index case.  
   * What is considered exposure?  Contact with index case 2 days before symptoms and anytime during illness.  
   * What types of contact are considered high risk? physical contact, less than six feet for more than 15 minites, > six feet apart bu inside the same indoor room for a long time (ie. one hour) because of the risk of exposure to surface contaminates.  Masked or unamsked? Contact local health department to consider community prevalance rate and determination of low, mid, or high risk exposures.  
   * Mortality rate of Covid if ages 65-75, 10 percent.  If  75-85, 4-10 percent, if >85, 10 percent die.
