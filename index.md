12-15-year-olds: A total of 3 SAEs from 1 month after Dose 2 in ongoing follow-up were reported in 3 recipients (2 BNT162b2, 1 placebo). All SAEs in BNT162b2 recipients were considered unrelated to vaccination by the study investigator and by FDA.
BNT162b2:
• 1 participant with constipation was diagnosed with functional abdominal pain after an
extensive work-up; the participant also developed generalized neuralgia beginning 1 day
after Dose 2 (described above).
• 1 participant with a long-standing history of ADHD and recent anxiety and depression
diagnoses (4 months and 10 days prior to enrollment, respectively) was hospitalized for
suicidal ideation 40 days after Dose 2. The event was ongoing at the time of the data cutoff date, but per the narrative provided by the Sponsor the event was assessed as
resolved on March 15, 2021. The study investigator attributed the participant’s symptoms
to psychosocial issues expressed by the participant as the cause of her exacerbation.
Placebo:
• One participant was hospitalized for appendicitis 63 days after the Dose 2 of placebo.
Symptoms were ongoing as of the data cutoff date.  page 31

- [Pfizer Updated EUA Sheet regarding Pfizer for ages 12-15 year olds, May 10, 2021](http://labeling.pfizer.com/ShowLabeling.aspx?id=14471)... *Serious adverse events are defined as:
Death
A life-threatening adverse event
Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions
A congenital anomaly/birth defect
An important medical event that based on appropriate medical judgement may jeopardize the individual and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above

About 6% of vaccine recipients experienced an adverse event, including seven cases of swollen lymph nodes. There were five serious adverse events in the vaccine group (0.4%) including one person with abdominal pain, constipation and neuralgia and others with depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation. None of the serious events were determined to be related to the vaccine and no deaths were reported. There also were no reports of blood clots, serious allergic reactions or Bell’s palsy....

## Mortality Rate in the United States

- [National Vital Statistics](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/provisional-tables.htm), all births, all deaths, all causes

**Testing Positivity Rate**  Lower than 5-7% indicates good community control.  This number reflects access to testing, contact tracing, and containment of community spread. Also an indirect measures of the question, "Does this community adhere to recommended public health measures: masks, social distancing, and hand washing?"

***Key talking points:***
>*Several statewide critical metrics are continuously tracked: hospital capacity, access to PPE, testing capacity, contact tracing success, protection of vulnerable populations, enforcement.  Concern for these metrics can influence interpretation of Covid data.*<br>  
Also,
>*If county meets two of the three criteria in two consecutive weeks it is flagged by the Task Force. (0=low risk, 1=growing risk, 2=moderate risk, 3=high level risk)*<br> 

1. At the county level elevated disease transmission is assessed by the following: 
   * Not enough tests (if avg # tests per day <150 per 100,000)
   * Case rate (if >200 per 100,000)
   * Case rate >50 per 100,000 AND test positivity > 7.0%
      
2. The Tast Force will assess each county's risk to determine whether the level should be continued, relaxed, or escalated.  In same areas, specific businesses or sectors may be targeted.
   * Baseline: current directive
   * Mitigation Level 1: target approach to reduce capcity and gathering in that county.  For example certain high risk settings like restaurants, the pool, gym, bar, the capacity may have capacity reducted from 50% to 25%, or a creed to reduce public gatherings to 25 people, etc, 
   * Mitigation 2: potential return to Phase 1 or to close indoor dining, etc.  *(updated 8-29-2020)*

***Key Points:***
> A person can be infected by Covid 19 and not know it.  The incubation period (time to developing sx) can be 2-14 days.  Avg incubation period is 5 days.  Person is most infectious to others on Day 1 of symptoms, but can be infectious to others from T minus 2 days (pre-symptomatic phase) to T + 10 days. (T = Day 1).  <br>

   * _Isolation_ keeps a sick person separate for the duration of the infectious period.  T-2 to T+10 days.  If symptoms improving and afebrile more than 24 hours can come out of isolation, whichever is longer *(as of 8-28-2020).*  
   * _Quarantine_ restricts the movement of healthy people for 14 days since last contact with index case.  
   * What is considered exposure?  Contact with index case 2 days before symptoms and anytime during illness.  
   * What types of contact are considered high risk? physical contact, less than six feet for more than 15 minites, > six feet apart but inside the same indoor room for a long time (ie. one hour) because of the risk of exposure to surface contaminates.  Masked or unamsked? Contact local health department to consider community prevalance rate, determination of low/mid/high risk exposures, and recommendation for quarantine.  
   * Death rate Rates for Covid: Ages 65-75, 2-5% mortality.  ages 75-85, 4-10% mortality, if age>85, 10% mortality . *(as of 8-29-2020)*
