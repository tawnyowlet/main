- [Clark County, Nevada](https://www.southernnevadahealthdistrict.org/coronavirus#cases). Data collected by the Southern Nevada Health District
- [State of Nevada Department of HHS](https://app.powerbigov.us/view?r=eyJrIjoiMjA2ZThiOWUtM2FlNS00MGY5LWFmYjUtNmQwNTQ3Nzg5N2I2IiwidCI6ImU0YTM0MGU2LWI4OWUtNGU2OC04ZWFhLTE1NDRkMjcwMzk4MCJ9). Statewide Data collection for Nevada
- [Covid 19 Projections](https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america).  National projections for USA
- [Daily Testing Trends in the United States](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/individual-states?fbclid=IwAR02lG-1TMD6qsQ8zJ1-sMgdR-NbrN5K2R80Few3Wpe1M3Hz7TsndHTLBeoWhenever), Testing Positivity Rate by JHU state by state.  Examine the local variation of test positivity rate. Lower than 5-7% indicates good community control.  This number is a reflection of access to testing, contact tracing, and containment of community spread with recommended quarantine and isolation. Also addresses the question, does your community adhere to other public health measures: masks, social distancing, hand washing?
- [Governor Sisolak Press Releases](https://nvhealthresponse.nv.gov/news-resources/press-releases/).  Highlights include the Aug 14 Road to Recovery.  
Critical statewide metrics: hospital capacity, access to PPE, testing capacity, contact tracing success, protection of vulnerable populations, enforcement.  
At the county level elevated disease transmission is assessed by the following: 
1. Not enough tests (if avg # tests per day <150 per 100,000)
2. Case rate (if >200 per 100,000)
3. Case rate >50 per 100,000 AND test positivity > 7.0%
If county meets two of the three criteria in 2 consecutive weeks it is flagged. (0 low risk, 1 growing risk, 2 moderate risk, 3 high level risk)

3 Mitigation levels: 
1. Baseline: current directive
2. Mitigation Level 1 target approach to reduce capcity and gathering in that county (or if high risk setting like food, pool, gym, bar, the capacity may be reduced from 50 to 25%) reduce gathering to 25 people, etc, 
3. Mitigation 2 potential return to Phase 1
