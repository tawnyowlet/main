## Covid 19 Resources for tracking disease
- [Clark County of Nevada COVID data](https://www.southernnevadahealthdistrict.org/coronavirus#cases), Collected by SNHD
- [State of Nevada COVID data](https://app.powerbigov.us/view?r=eyJrIjoiMjA2ZThiOWUtM2FlNS00MGY5LWFmYjUtNmQwNTQ3Nzg5N2I2IiwidCI6ImU0YTM0MGU2LWI4OWUtNGU2OC04ZWFhLTE1NDRkMjcwMzk4MCJ9), Collected by Nevada HHS
- [National Covid 19 Projections](https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america), Collected by IHME
- [Daily Testing Trends per State](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/individual-states?fbclid=IwAR02lG-1TMD6qsQ8zJ1-sMgdR-NbrN5K2R80Few3Wpe1M3Hz7TsndHTLBeoWhenever), collected by JHU  
**Testing Positivity Rate**  Lower than 5-7% indicates good community control.  This number reflects access to testing, contact tracing, and containment of community spread. Also an indirect measures of the question, "Does this community adhere to recommended public health measures: masks, social distancing, and hand washing?"

- ***Aug 14, 2020 Nevada [Road to Recovery](https://nvhealthresponse.nv.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Road-to-Recovery.pdf) key talking points:***

>*Several statewide critical metrics which are continuously tracked: hospital capacity, access to PPE, testing capacity, contact tracing success, protection of vulnerable populations, enforcement, and can supercede Covid Data.*<br>  

Also,
>*If county meets two of the three criteria in 2 consecutive weeks it is flagged by the Task Force. (0=low risk, 1=growing risk, 2=moderate risk, 3=high level risk)*<br> 

1. At the county level elevated disease transmission is assessed by the following: 
   * Not enough tests (if avg # tests per day <150 per 100,000)
   * Case rate (if >200 per 100,000)
   * Case rate >50 per 100,000 AND test positivity > 7.0%
      
2. The Tast Force will assess each county's risk to determine whether the level should be continued, relaxed, or escalated.  In same areas, specific businesses or sectors may be targeted.
   * Baseline: current directive
   * Mitigation Level 1: target approach to reduce capcity and gathering in that county.  For example certain high risk settings like restaurants, the pool, gym, bar, the capacity may have capacity reducted from 50% to 25%, or a creed to reduce public gatherings to 25 people, etc, 
   * Mitigation 2: potential return to Phase 1 or to close indoor dining, etc.  *(updated 8-29-2020)*

***Key Points:***
> A person can be infected by Covid 18 and not know it.  The incubation period (time to developing sx) can be 2-14 days.  Avg incubation period is 5 days.  Person is most infectious to others on Day 1 of symptoms, but can be infectious to others from T minus 2 days (pre-symptomatic phase) to T + 10 days. (T = Day 1).  <br>
   * _Isolation_ keeps a sick person separate for the duration of the infectious period.  T-2 to T+10 days and if symptoms improving and afebrile more than 24 hours can come out of isolation, whichever is longer *(as of 8-28-2020).*  
   * _Quarantine_ restricts the movement of healthy people for 14 days since last contact with index case.  
   * What is considered exposure?  Contact with index case 2 days before symptoms and anytime during illness.  
   * What types of contact are considered high risk? physical contact, less than six feet for more than 15 minites, > six feet apart but inside the same indoor room for a long time (ie. one hour) because of the risk of exposure to surface contaminates.  Masked or unamsked? Contact local health department to consider community prevalance rate and determination of low, mid, or high risk exposures and recommendation for quarantine.  
   * Mortality rate of Covid if ages 65-75, 10 percent.  If  75-85, 4-10 percent, if >85, 10 percent die. *(updated 8-29-2020)*
